# Churn Analysis and Prediction Project

 # Overview
This project involves performing a comprehensive churn analysis to identify patterns and predict customer churn using MySQL, Power BI, WPS Excel, and Jupyter Notebook.

# Technologies Used
- MySQL: Data cleaning and transformation
- Power BI: Summary and prediction reports
- WPS Excel: Data import
- Python (Jupyter Notebook): Random forest prediction model

# Steps Involved
1. **Data Cleaning and Transformation** : Used MySQL to clean and transform the data, making it more user-friendly and ready for analysis.
2. **Summary Report**: Created a summary report in Power BI using the updated database to visualize key metrics and insights.
3. **Data Import**: Imported the data from MySQL to WPS Excel, then used its path in Jupyter Notebook for further analysis.
4. **Prediction Model**: Developed a random forest prediction model in Jupyter Notebook to predict customer churn and created a prediction report in Power BI using the model output.
